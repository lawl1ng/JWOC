Journeys Within Our Community Data Analysis

JWOC is a non-profit based in Cambodia who's mission is: "To partner with low-income Cambodian youth to fulfill their potential in education, employment and engagement with their community."

This repo contains exploratory data analysis of a small dataset of reasons people dropped out of the programs from 2019 - 2024 (some data which we do not have the year for). The aim is to help drive decisions based on data insights. 

As of 20th March 2025 additional data was added.
